## Why Develop httpz

The `net/http` version 1.22 has enhanced routing capabilities, allowing us to develop a complete web project without third-party routers (frameworks) like `Echo`, `gin`, and `chi`. However, the standard library's pursuit of simplicity makes its user experience less convenient than third-party frameworks.

For example:

1. Grouping is inconvenient. `net/http` uses the `Handle(pattern, http.Handler)` function to forward requests of the same group to `http.Handler`, which is not easy to manage. In contrast, the `Echo` framework directly uses `Group(pattern)` to achieve this.

2. Centralized error handling in Echo is a good practice. We should return errors in the `handler`, which can reduce the workload of error handling.

3. Data binding needs to be implemented manually. When a handler needs to bind many request parameters, `net/http` requires you to bind them one by one.

4. When returning a response, `net/http` requires you to manually set the response headers, status code, and response body, which can lead to repetitive code.

## What is httpz

httpz is a collection of the following features:

  - Based on `net/http` version 1.22+
  - Global error handling
  - Convenient grouping
  - Middleware from chi
  - Data binding from Echo
  - Quick response returns

httpz is merely an enhancement library for `net/http`, not a new framework. Using httpz is essentially developing with the `net/http` standard library.

httpz is fully compatible with `net/http`, allowing you to choose to use httpz's enhanced features or directly use `net/http`.

## Design Philosophy

- Zero dependencies, all features are implemented based on the `net/http` API.
- Convenient and non-intrusive. You can still develop using the `net/http` conventions.
- It is an enhancement library, not a new framework.
